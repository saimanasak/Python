Given a day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, 
and a boolean indicating if we are on vacation, 
return a string of the form "7:00" indicating when the alarm clock should ring. 
Weekdays, the alarm should be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". 
Unless we are on vacation -- then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off".

alarm_clock(1, False) â†’ '7:00'
alarm_clock(5, False) â†’ '7:00'
alarm_clock(0, False) â†’ '10:00'
